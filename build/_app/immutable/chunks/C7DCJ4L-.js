Freeform means that contributors have complete editorial freedom; one of the station's founding principles was the lack of any prescribed playlist. We endeavour to platform as diverse a range of shows as possible, no genre or concept is off-limits.

History
The story of Subcity begins in 1993, with a Restricted Service Licence FM station named "Sweet FM" broadcasting from an unused Murano flat. In October 1995, the station became SubCity (the capitalisation and spacing has varied over the years) and in 2000 the station found a permanent home in the McIntyre building of UofG. In 2002 the station was granted a 5-year AM license, but this was discontinued soon after it as the university complained it was causing interference on their phone lines. Since 2003 the station has broadcast online. 2023 brings the long awaited revamp of subcity.org, the latest iteration of Subcity's ever evolving web presence. Read more about the station's activities through the years on the Archive page

Personnel
Subcity is staffed entirely by volunteers, and the team tends largely made up of mostly students. Being a student is not a requirement however, and anyone is welcome to apply for a role. The team is loosely structured and non-hierarchical; the only official position is that of manager. This role is taken on by a new team member (or pair of team members) for each academic year. Our current manager is Skyler, previously our design team's coordinator. Our current assistant manager is Daphne, who also serves as our archives coordinator. There are many sub-teams within Subcity, including programmes, support, comms, tech, web, and archives. People on the team tend to gravitate towards one of these as their main area of contribution, but are free to help out with any of the other teams as they please. Most of these teams have a designated coordinator. This is someone who takes on additional responsibility to make sure that the team works effectively, and meets directly with the manager(s) to coordinate the actions of each team towards common goals. When Subcity is organising an event everyone in the team is encouraged to pitch in. This means that there is no distinct events team.

The station has over 100 active contributors; these are the people that run the shows broadcast on Subcity. Many of these contributors are also team members. Some people start out as a contributor, then join the team. Many ex-team members continue to play a show on Subcity, some remain contributors for years after leaving the team.

It was with this idea in mind that Younes and Omar created Ness Radio in 2008. The former, a French-Moroccan living in Marrakech, and the latter, a French-Algerian living in Paris, lamented that "alternative" or "underground" musical styles remain underrepresented in Morocco and, more broadly, in the world. It was this observation that led them to embark on the Ness Radio adventure, without really knowing where it would take them.

Many years later, Ness Radio has far surpassed its initial ambitions and broadcasts its eclectic programming to an ever-growing audience from all corners of the globe. Alongside Younes and Omar, nearly 30 passionate individuals have now joined the Ness Crew : DJs, writers, programmers, presenters… A wealth of talent and enthusiasm tirelessly explores the latest trends in house, electro, jazz, soul, and hip-hop, keeping a close eye on the newest releases from the most prestigious labels, and diligently (re)discovering forgotten gems to share with you. With members based in Marrakech, London, Paris, Vienna, Brussels, and even California, the Ness Crew is now a true dream team, bringing together both big names in today's independent music scene and passionate individuals, all eager for the freshest sounds.

Today a music blog and web radio with a cutting-edge program , also available on TuneIn , Radio Garden , and iTunes Radio, Ness Radio is proud to be one of the new faces of the music experience in the digital age. With a focus on quality and a strong editorial line, Ness Radio brings together music lovers from all over the world. Free from advertising, it champions respect for both listeners and artists by purchasing their original tracks to introduce them to a new audience. Ness Radio exists only thanks to the passionate individuals who dedicate themselves to keeping it alive. Beyond musical and geographical boundaries, Ness Radio's primary goal is to unite music lovers around a carefully curated selection of tracks, both old and new, well-known and rare, in their original versions or rearranged. Listen, comment, participate: sharing and exchange are the cornerstones of Ness Radio!

Through our radio broadcasts, myriad public events and cultural projects, dublab has fostered a community in Cologne and around the world that places creativity, enrichment, diversity, inclusivity and equality as valued priorities. Keeping music as the organization’s main focus, the dublab community continues to grow and use its voice to bring positive change.

dublab’s airwaves allow space for diverse styles, eras, genres and music cultures to co-exist, and our DJs are empowered to freely play sounds they are passionate about, making each show distinct. We take pride in featuring a genre bending music policy, and partner with likeminded initiatives, record shops, labels or festivals.

Community radio projects have a special place in our heart, and we have been fortunate to realize a few of those (1/2/3/4) over the last years.

Working in transitory spaces and at the intersections between different fields, organising sound, music and words into new forms of knowledge, PASS is a machine for travelling at the speed of thought – it borrows its slogan “There are other worlds out there they never told you about” from the philosopher, composer and bandleader Sun Ra.

PASS seeks to challenge the concepts this present has of Africa and to excite new transitory and transient communities with each journey, bringing focus to collective experience and targeting an investigation into how we locate ourselves and how we mediate our human and historic commonality. Method

Taking advantage of both the intimacy and unpredictability of the live studio and the reach and scope of the internet, PASS seeks to forge new collaborations across time and space. The live studio becomes one for entangling different realities and experiences – with participants and listeners prompted by ideas of utopia and oppression, history and the future, borders, time, art and technology, and, more importantly, community. A combination of live conversations, travelogues, discussion sessions and performances, together with exhibitions of new and archival material interrogate our shared histories.

PASS landings may be connected to larger events – festivals, conferences, exhibitions – or as independent interventions. The programming of each pop-up studio is curated by Chimurenga in collaboration with local cultural producers and thinkers.

PASS has landed in and transmitted from Johannesburg, Paris, London, New York, Lagos, Amsterdam, Helsinki, Cairo, Dakar, Mexico City and Harare featuring over 150 artists, musicians, writers, activists and more.

At the end of each live event, recordings are recirculated via the livestream, and uploaded as podcasts to Chimurenga’s Mixcloud page, culminating in an ongoing archive of conversations and experiences. Thus, through a single event, the PASS pop-up studio aims to bring together the processes of creation and production; documentation and archiving, and, finally, dissemination and broadcasting.

Other PASS projects include a series of intimate performance-lectures titled “Stories About Music in Africa”, and stand-alone live events featuring the likes of Floating Points, Ayetoro, Studio Kabako, Cindy Blackman, Anthony Joseph, Philip Tabane, Georgia Anne Muldrow, Toumani Diabate, Netsayi and many, many more.`,FIELD7:"",slug:"pan-african-space-station",url:"https://panafricanspacestation.org.za/",audio:"https://pass.airtime.pro/embed/player?stream=auto",status:"",hero:"",tile:"",highlight:"ABA294",fill:"9B5E2F",sparkle:"331614",mosaicBg:"9B5E2F"},{name:"Ida Radio",city:"Helsinki",country:"Finland",utc:"+3",timezone:"Europe/Helsinki",about:"IDA is an online community radio based in Tallinn & Helsinki.",FIELD7:"",slug:"ida-radio-helsinki",url:"https://idaidaida.net/",audio:"https://broadcast.idaidaida.net:8000/stream",status:"",hero:"https://weare-europe.eu/public/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-03-at-16.10.59-1-1024x676.png",tile:"",highlight:"690C1B",fill:"DBCDC2",sparkle:"331614",mosaicBg:"690C1B"},{name:"Ida Radio",city:"Tallinn",country:"Estonia",utc:"+3",timezone:"Europe/Tallinn",about:"IDA is an online community radio based in Tallinn & Helsinki.",FIELD7:"",slug:"ida-radio-tallinn",url:"https://idaidaida.net/",audio:"https://broadcast.idaidaida.net:8000/stream",status:"",hero:"https://weare-europe.eu/public/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-06-03-at-16.10.59-1-1024x676.png",tile:"",highlight:"690C1B",fill:"DBCDC2",sparkle:"331614",mosaicBg:"690C1B"},{name:"Stegi Radio (A)",city:"Athens",country:"Greece",utc:"·",timezone:"Europe/Athens",about:`movement radio is an international online radio station based in Athens.

Since April 2025, Mutant Radio has expanded to Berlin with a compact studio, opening fresh connections for local and international communities.`,FIELD7:"",slug:"mutant-radio",url:"https://mutantradio.net/",audio:"https://listen.radioking.com/radio/282820/stream/328621",status:"",hero:"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS1RAR_ny9RcaghS1B2SsuujoXfAvpC_Vvhhw&usqp=CAU",tile:"",highlight:"96B8E3",fill:"D03D02",sparkle:"331614",mosaicBg:"96B8E3"},{name:"Norrm Radio",city:"Bandung",country:"Indonesia",utc:"·",timezone:"Asia/Jakarta",about:"Norrm Radio exists to explore, curate, communicate and define our contemporary alternative culture and identity.

Born during Melbourne’s 2020 lockdowns, when the future of live music and nightclubbing was uncertain, Area 3000 was created to give artists—especially emerging and underrepresented voices—a platform to share their music and stories. We connect our local dance music scene to the wider community through 24/7 broadcasting, storytelling podcasts, live events, and artist development.

Our mission is to bring people together through the power of music by delivering diverse, innovative, and immersive experiences. Our studio is based in Revolver Lane, a creative co-working space in Prahran, Melbourne, on Wurundjeri land.

We acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the land on which we broadcast and pay our respects to their Elders—past, present, and emerging.`,FIELD7:"",slug:"area-3000",url:"https://www.area3000.radio/",audio:"https://area-3000.radiocult.fm/stream",status:"",hero:"https://scontent-syd2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/240859246_4589113854446627_3653740827607424458_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-syd2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=YlOydpcl764AX_CbZUA&edm=AP_V10EBAAAA&ccb=7-4&oh=00_AT_LcJ_tOVt6H2d9gCQ_RVDxbkweARbOoMbvAFF_ArAzNQ&oe=6263C44C&_nc_sid=4f375e",tile:"",highlight:"8A96B0",fill:"0000FF",sparkle:"F4F2EA",mosaicBg:"0000FF"}];function Y(i,n){A(n,!1);let s=M(n,"query",8),e,a,o=m(!1),t=m(!1);S(()=>(u(o,!0),()=>{d()}));function r(f){e=window.matchMedia(f),a=b=>u(t,b.matches),e.addListener(a),u(t,e.matches)}function d(){e&&a&&e.removeListener(a)}F(()=>(c(o),R(s())),()=>{c(o)&&(d(),r(s()))}),E(),x();var l=I(),g=D(l);T(g,n,"default",{get matches(){return c(t)}}),L(i,l),B()}export{V as H,Y as M,U as a,K as b,J as s,q as t};
