    "about-original": `Subcity Radio (est. 1995) is a non-profit, volunteer-run freeform radio station, arts collective, and events promoter based at the University of Glasgow. Our team applications are open twice a year to the local community, and show applications are open year round.

Freeform means that contributors have complete editorial freedom; one of the station's founding principles was the lack of any prescribed playlist. We endeavour to platform as diverse a range of shows as possible, no genre or concept is off-limits.

History
The story of Subcity begins in 1993, with a Restricted Service Licence FM station named "Sweet FM" broadcasting from an unused Murano flat. In October 1995, the station became SubCity (the capitalisation and spacing has varied over the years) and in 2000 the station found a permanent home in the McIntyre building of UofG. In 2002 the station was granted a 5-year AM license, but this was discontinued soon after it as the university complained it was causing interference on their phone lines. Since 2003 the station has broadcast online. 2023 brings the long awaited revamp of subcity.org, the latest iteration of Subcity's ever evolving web presence. Read more about the station's activities through the years on the Archive page

Personnel
Subcity is staffed entirely by volunteers, and the team tends largely made up of mostly students. Being a student is not a requirement however, and anyone is welcome to apply for a role. The team is loosely structured and non-hierarchical; the only official position is that of manager. This role is taken on by a new team member (or pair of team members) for each academic year. Our current manager is Skyler, previously our design team's coordinator. Our current assistant manager is Daphne, who also serves as our archives coordinator. There are many sub-teams within Subcity, including programmes, support, comms, tech, web, and archives. People on the team tend to gravitate towards one of these as their main area of contribution, but are free to help out with any of the other teams as they please. Most of these teams have a designated coordinator. This is someone who takes on additional responsibility to make sure that the team works effectively, and meets directly with the manager(s) to coordinate the actions of each team towards common goals. When Subcity is organising an event everyone in the team is encouraged to pitch in. This means that there is no distinct events team.

The station has over 100 active contributors; these are the people that run the shows broadcast on Subcity. Many of these contributors are also team members. Some people start out as a contributor, then join the team. Many ex-team members continue to play a show on Subcity, some remain contributors for years after leaving the team.

    "timezone": "Europe/Brussels",
    "about-original": `Radio Panik is a free radio station that defines itself as a community radio station for expression and creation, and as a multi- and intercultural radio station. It was created in 1983 by a group of people campaigning against racism and for human rights.

Their motivations, which remain relevant today, are well summarized in its statutes:

"The association's purpose is to contribute – primarily through broadcasting – to the socio-cultural development of the population in the Brussels region. Its aim is the genuine emancipation of individuals while respecting cultural differences and democratic procedures."

Radio Panik was therefore part of that first generation of free radio stations considered "committed" for their activist work promoting a critical approach to information. While its involvement at the local level, both socially and culturally, gradually became one of its priority objectives, it never lost sight of its "generalist" mission and remains, within an increasingly uniform media landscape, a communication tool whose marginal position fosters freedom, independence, and diversity.

Having occupied several addresses in Saint-Josse and Schaerbeek, Radio Panik has managed to reconcile local and international news, information and creation, opening up to the various communities that make Brussels a true cultural crossroads, a space "without borders", open to the expression of "parallel voices" that invite us to hear, between the airwaves, another sound of the bell.

Today, Radio Panik has been supported by the Ministry of the French Community since 2006, and since 2011 has been recognized as a Continuing Education association. Since 2008 it has also benefited from the status of "community radio station with a cultural or continuing education focus".`,

    "about-original": `Ness Radio is first and foremost a desire, not to say a need: to offer alternative music programming to share, introduce, and foster connections. It was with this idea in mind that Younes and Omar created Ness Radio in 2008. The former, a French-Moroccan living in Marrakech, and the latter, a French-Algerian living in Paris, lamented that "alternative" or "underground" musical styles remain underrepresented in Morocco and, more broadly, in the world. It was this observation that led them to embark on the Ness Radio adventure, without really knowing where it would take them.

Many years later, Ness Radio has far surpassed its initial ambitions and broadcasts its eclectic programming to an ever-growing audience from all corners of the globe. Alongside Younes and Omar, nearly 30 passionate individuals have now joined the Ness Crew : DJs, writers, programmers, presenters… A wealth of talent and enthusiasm tirelessly explores the latest trends in house, electro, jazz, soul, and hip-hop, keeping a close eye on the newest releases from the most prestigious labels, and diligently (re)discovering forgotten gems to share with you. With members based in Marrakech, London, Paris, Vienna, Brussels, and even California, the Ness Crew is now a true dream team, bringing together both big names in today's independent music scene and passionate individuals, all eager for the freshest sounds.

Today a music blog and web radio with a cutting-edge program , also available on TuneIn , Radio Garden , and iTunes Radio, Ness Radio is proud to be one of the new faces of the music experience in the digital age. With a focus on quality and a strong editorial line, Ness Radio brings together music lovers from all over the world. Free from advertising, it champions respect for both listeners and artists by purchasing their original tracks to introduce them to a new audience. Ness Radio exists only thanks to the passionate individuals who dedicate themselves to keeping it alive. Beyond musical and geographical boundaries, Ness Radio's primary goal is to unite music lovers around a carefully curated selection of tracks, both old and new, well-known and rare, in their original versions or rearranged. Listen, comment, participate: sharing and exchange are the cornerstones of Ness Radio!

    "about-original": "Founded by Chimurenga in collaboration with musician and composer Neo Muyanga in 2008, the Pan African Space Station (PASS) is a periodic, pop-up live radio studio; a performance and exhibition space; a research platform and living archive, as well as an ongoing, internet based radio station.\n\nWorking in transitory spaces and at the intersections between different fields, organising sound, music and words into new forms of knowledge, PASS is a machine for travelling at the speed of thought – it borrows its slogan “There are other worlds out there they never told you about” from the philosopher, composer and bandleader Sun Ra.\n\nPASS seeks to challenge the concepts this present has of Africa and to excite new transitory and transient communities with each journey, bringing focus to collective experience and targeting an investigation into how we locate ourselves and how we mediate our human and historic commonality. Method\n\nTaking advantage of both the intimacy and unpredictability of the live studio and the reach and scope of the internet, PASS seeks to forge new collaborations across time and space. The live studio becomes one for entangling different realities and experiences – with participants and listeners prompted by ideas of utopia and oppression, history and the future, borders, time, art and technology, and, more importantly, community. A combination of live conversations, travelogues, discussion sessions and performances, together with exhibitions of new and archival material interrogate our shared histories.\n\nPASS landings may be connected to larger events – festivals, conferences, exhibitions – or as independent interventions. The programming of each pop-up studio is curated by Chimurenga in collaboration with local cultural producers and thinkers.\n\nPASS has landed in and transmitted from Johannesburg, Paris, London, New York, Lagos, Amsterdam, Helsinki, Cairo, Dakar, Mexico City and Harare featuring over 150 artists, musicians, writers, activists and more.\n\nAt the end of each live event, recordings are recirculated via the livestream, and uploaded as podcasts to Chimurenga’s Mixcloud page, culminating in an ongoing archive of conversations and experiences. Thus, through a single event, the PASS pop-up studio aims to bring together the processes of creation and production; documentation and archiving, and, finally, dissemination and broadcasting.\n\nOther PASS projects include a series of intimate performance-lectures titled “Stories About Music in Africa”, and stand-alone live events featuring the likes of Floating Points, Ayetoro, Studio Kabako, Cindy Blackman, Anthony Joseph, Philip Tabane, Georgia Anne Muldrow, Toumani Diabate, Netsayi and many, many more.",
