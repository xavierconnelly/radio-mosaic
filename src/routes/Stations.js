The current coronavirus pandemic struck a heavy blow to an already fragile counterculture ecosystem, rendering the survival of underground artists virtually impossible.

Broadcasting 24/7, with a mix of fortnightly, monthly and seasonal shows, the radio acts as a rallying space for Belgium’s often-overlooked underground talent, a platform that unites the country’s disparate scenes under one same banner. Expect anything from talk shows, DJ sets and live performances from our more than 100 monthly residents - all Belgian or based in Belgium - as well as the odd guest or two thrown in for good measure. The Word Radio is supported by Sabam for Culture."

   "about": "In a time of need for a coping mechanism, we thought of starting an online broadcast of love, music, and stories. We firmly believe that now more than ever, women’s voices matter. That they are important, if not crucial in these times of crisis of capitalism and patriarchy. The womxn behind Hammam Radio are Abir, Rasha, Paola, Jojo, and Hayat. Hammam Radio is meant to be a place where women in all their diversity meet, talk, participate, think, shout, cry, laugh, become angry, love, and raise their voices. We will be cursing, dancing, singing, playing music, and songs that reflect our moods and current state. We will also be reading, telling stories, and everything else in between."
